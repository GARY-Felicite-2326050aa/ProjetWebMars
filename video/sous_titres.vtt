00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.500
I play the same game at home

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
oh

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.800
report

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.200
yeah

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.300
So

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.400
Could you see yourself ending your life in Marseille?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.300
Now that's a good question

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.400
Stop

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.900
"The balloon, the balloon"

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.400
That's so cool, what are you doing?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.200
What's the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.000
I have a channel on Youtube

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.900
And in general I tell stories, my life blah blah blah

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.400
But

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.500
I've been living here for a while.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.200
And I might be moving,
I want to move

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.300
But before I move

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.100
I want to make the ultimate video about Marseille

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.200
Ah, that's it you!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.300
A monkey neutralized with a taser in Castellane!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.300
Watch

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.200
It's a little blurry, but you can see!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.300
You can see it!

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.200
Hey, where are all the noisy people tonight?
